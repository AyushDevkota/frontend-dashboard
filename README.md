## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I am now fairly comfortable in creating complex grid structures using grid-areas. I strugggled with grid-area in the past and always avoided using it but now using it in my last couple of projects creating grid structures for all screen sizes without major change in code, I will now continue using it.
